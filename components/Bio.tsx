	I am a Research Engineer on the FAIR Chemistry team. My current research focuses on deep learning applications to addressing broad challenges in molecules and materials discovery. Building open datasets, frameworks, and tools to accelerate community research is something I am particularly fond of. Before that, I completed my PhD in Chemical Engineering with Zachary W. Ulissi.
